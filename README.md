# AGROMITRA: Smart Farming with Market Demand Insight

## Overview

AGROMITRA harnesses the power of AI to revolutionize farming by providing farmers with data-driven insights for better crop yields and alignment with market demands. Our solution is aimed at empowering farmers to make informed decisions that improve crop selection, enhance sustainability, and increase profitability.

This project provides a one-stop platform for farmers to input their preferences, location, land size, and crop history to get tailored recommendations. These insights are supported by a combination of market demand analysis, soil health evaluation, and yield optimization strategies.

## Problem Statement

Modern farming is challenged by the need for sustainability and alignment with market trends. Farmers often lack access to real-time data and analytics that could help them make optimized decisions about crop choice, soil health, and market demand.

AGROMITRA seeks to:

- Empower farmers with market-based intelligence and optimized farming practices.
- Provide tailored crop recommendations with demand scores based on market analysis.
- Implement crop rotation models and soil health assessments for better sustainability.
- Guide farmers from planting to selling, ensuring alignment with current market trends.

## Key Features

- **Market Demand Analysis**: Identifies high-demand crops and vegetables based on market trends and seasonal patterns.
- **Tailored Crop Planning**: Suggests optimal crops based on the farmer's location, land size, and crop rotation history.
- **Soil & Crop Health Evaluation**: Analyzes soil type, nutrients, pH, and moisture to assess crop health and recommend improvements.
- **Yield Prediction & Optimization**: Estimates potential yield and provides strategies to maximize productivity based on soil and environmental factors.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Shadcn, Tailwind, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Express.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM
- **Machine Learning**: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, FastAPI
- **IoT Integration**: For real-time soil, weather, and crop health data (planned future expansion)
- **E-Commerce Integration**: Planned for future updates to enable direct market access for farmers

## How It Works

1. Farmers input their preferences including:
   - Crop type
   - Location
   - Land size
   - Previous crops
   - Soil details

2. The system analyzes:
   - Market demand for crops
   - Soil health and crop rotation history
   - Seasonal and environmental factors

3. Based on the analysis, farmers receive:
   - Crop recommendations tailored to their land and market trends
   - Soil health scores and suggestions for improvement
   - Predicted yield and optimization strategies

4. The platform helps farmers track crop health and make decisions about harvesting and selling, aligned with market demand.

## Future Growth

- **Precision Agriculture**: Integration with IoT devices for real-time data collection on soil, weather, and crop health.
- **E-Commerce Integration**: Direct market access for farmers to increase profitability.
- **Global Insights**: Expand to offer international market demand and export opportunities.
- **Sustainability Focus**: Integrate climate models for eco-friendly farming and adaptation to climate changes.
- **Linguistic Barriers**: Provide multilingual support to break down language and cultural barriers for all farmers.
